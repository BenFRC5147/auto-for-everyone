# auto-for-everyone
An open-source effort to help all teams achieve a cross-the-line auto in 2018

# Help Us Build The Library
We need help building a library that can help any team, in any language, with any speed controlelrs, cross the line in autonomous.  If you'd like to submit code to help build this library, please make a pull request.  There are just a few simple rules:
  1. Don't change others' code.
  2. Comment your code well so others can more easily understand and learn from it.
